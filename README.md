# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is a repository for the Week-4 Lesson-4 project for the course 'Getting and Cleaning Data'.

This repository contains the R-script 'run_analysis.R', which does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repository also contains a codebook in 'CodeBook.md' that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

The results of the 'run_analysis.R' file are shown in the text file 'TidyData.txt'.
